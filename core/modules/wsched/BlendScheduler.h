/// BlendScheduler is a scheduler that places queries in one of
/// 4 sub-schedulers. Interactive queries are placed on the GroupScheduler
/// _group, which has the highest priority. Other queries, which are
/// expected to require all, or most, of the chunks on this node, go
/// to one of the ScanSchedulers: _scanFast, _scanMedium, _scanSlow.
/// The priority is _group, _scanFast, _scanMedium, _scaneSlow. This
/// should match the list in _schedulers.
///
/// There are several constraints BlendSheduler places on the sub-schedulers.
/// The schedulers run Tasks in a limited pool of threads. At any time,
/// all sub-schedulers should be able to run at least one thread. This is to
/// keep sub-schedulers from getting jammed by heavy loads, or prevent
/// high priority/fast sub-schedulers being stuck waiting for low priority/slow
/// sub-schedulers to finish a Task.
///
/// Each sub-scheduler wants to have some number of threads reserved for it.
/// The ScanScheduler schedulers work better with 2 Tasks running at the same time
/// as the Tasks running at the same time should be sharing some resources and
/// are unlikely to finish at the same time. The resources the 2 were
/// using remain locked when 1 stops, and a new Task that uses the same resources
/// can start immediately. If only one Task for a ScanScheduler is running,
/// and it finishes, it's resources would be unlocked, and if the next Task
/// needed those resources, it would have to lock them again.
///
/// Since we might only have a few threads available, say 12, and 3 schedulers
/// not running any Tasks, reserving 6 threads could seriously hurt throughput.
/// So, each scheduler will only reserve 1 more thread than it has Tasks inFlight,
/// leaving at most 3 threads unavailable at any given time.
///
/// Secondly, the ScanScheduler schedulers are only allowed to advance to a new chunk
/// if resources are available to read the chunk into memory, or if the sub-scheduler
/// has no Tasks inFlight.
