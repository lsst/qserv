     * Connect to the MySQL service with the specified parameters and if successfully
     * connected return a pointer to the Connection object. Otherwise an exception will
     * be thrown.
     *
     * A behavior of a connector created by the method depends on default values
     * of Configuration parameters returned by Configuration::databaseAllowReconnect()
     * and Configuration::databaseConnectTimeoutSec(). If the automatic reconnect is
     * allowed then multiple connection attempts to a database service can be made
     * before the connection timeout expires or until some problem which can't be
     * resolved with the allowed connection retries happens.
     *
     * @note MySQL auto-commits are disabled
     * @note MySQL automatic re-connects are not allowed because this Connector class
     *   implements its own protocol for reconnects (when allowed)
     * @note connections are always open with option MYSQL_PROTOCOL_TCP.
     * @note MySQL option MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE is always enabled to allow
     *   queries like 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ...'. This protocol is used in the bulk
     *   data ingest scenarios in which input files can't be directly placed at a location
     *   accessible by the MySQL server. Be aware that this way of loading data requires
     *   the server to be configured with global variable 'local_infile=1'. Another related
     *   requirement is that MySQL client library was compiled with option '-DENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE=true'.
