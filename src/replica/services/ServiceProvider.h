     *   have little or any benefits from the performance point of view. Secondly, it may complicate
     *   the "garbage collection" of unused mutexes, this (potentially) resulting in non-negligible

     * @see class NamedMutexRegistry
     *
     * Mutex objects returned by the method are expected to be used together with class replica::Lock
     * as it's shown below (both ways are the same):
     * @code
     *   // Okay
     *   auto mutex = serviceProvider->getNamedMutex("name");
     *   replica::Lock lock(mutex);
     *   // The better option
     *   replica::Lock lock(serviceProvider->getNamedMutex("name"));
     * @code
     * Class replica::Lock makes a copy of the shared pointer for a duration of the lock.
     *
     * If, for some reason, a code resorts to using low-level references/pointers to the stored mutex
     * object then, please, make sure the shared pointer outlives the lock. This comment relates
     * to the locking made like shown below:
     * @code
     *   auto mutex = serviceProvider->getNamedMutex("name");
     *   replica::Lock lock(*mutex);
     *   std::lock_guard<replica::Mutex> lock(*mutex);
     * @code
     * Though, in general this would work, the above shown dereferencing is not recommended.
     *
     * @param database The name of a named mutex.
     * @return A smart pointer to a mutex for the name.
     * @throw std::invalid_argument If the name is empty.
