/**
 * The schema definition is nested dictionary in which the top-level key reprsents
 * the so called "categories" of parameters. Each entry under a category defines
 * a single parameter. Values of these parameters are obtained and modified
 * using the Configuration API methods 'get<T>` and 'set<T>`.
 *
 * All parameters have two mandatory attributes:
 *  - The attribute "description" contains the documentation string explaining the attribute
 *  - The attribute "default" holds the default value of the attribute. The value's type depends
 *    on the attribute's role, and once it's defined here it's enforced through the rest of
 *    the implementation. For instance, the type can't be changed via the method 'Configuration::set<T>'.
 *
 * Some parameters are also allowed to have the optional attributes:
 *   - The attribute "read-only" set to 1 would indicate that the parameter's state
 *     can't be changed via method 'Configuration::set<T>'.
 *   - The attribute "empty-allowed" set to 1 would relax parameter value's validation
 *     by method 'Configuration::set<T>' to allow 0 for numeric types and the empty string
 *     fr strings.
 *   - The attribute "security-context" if set to 1 would indicate to the API user that
 *     the parameter has some the security-sensitive context (passwords, authorization keys,
 *     etc.). Parameters possesing this attribute are supposed to be used with care by
 *     the dependent automation tools to avoid exposing sensitive information in log files,
 *     reports, etc.
