/// The czar is expected to heavily use the

///    `getMaps() -> ChunkMap` is expected to be more useful if there is a
///  failure and a chunk query needs to go to a different worker.
///
/// Workers failing or new workers being added is expected to be a rare event.
/// The current algorithm to split chunks between the workers tries to split
/// the work evenly. However, if a new worker is added, it's likely that
/// the new distribution of chunks for shared scans will put the chunks on
/// different workers than previously, which in turn will result in the system
/// being less efficient until all the old scans are complete. If workers
/// being added or removed from the system becomes frequent, the algorithm should
/// probably change to try to maintain some chunk location consistency once
/// the system is up.
