/// This class is used to organize worker chunk table information so that it
/// can be used to send jobs to the appropriate worker and inform workers
/// what chunks they can expect to handle in shared scans.
/// The data for the maps is provided by the Replicator and stored in the
/// QMeta database.
/// When the data is changed, there is a timestamp that is updated, which
/// will cause new maps to be made by this class.
///
/// The maps generated are constant objects stored with shared pointers. As
/// such, it should be possible for numerous threads to use each map
/// simultaneously provided they have their own pointers to the maps.
/// The pointers to the maps are mutex protected to safely allow map updates.
///
/// The czar is expected to heavily use the
///    `getMaps() -> WorkerChunkMap -> getSharedScanChunkMap()`
/// to send jobs to workers, as that gets an ordered list of all chunks
/// the worker should handle during a shared scan.
///    `getMaps() -> ChunkMap` is expected to be more useful if there is a
///  failure and a chunk query needs to go to a different worker.
///
/// Workers failing or new workers being added is expected to be a rare event.
/// The current algorithm to split chunks between the workers tries to split
/// the work evenly. However, if a new worker is added, it's likely that
/// the new distribution of chunks for shared scans will put the chunks on
/// different workers than previously, which in turn will result in the system
/// being less efficient until all the old scans are complete. If workers
/// being added or removed from the system becomes frequent, the algorithm should
/// probably change to try to maintain some chunk location consistency once
/// the system is up.
