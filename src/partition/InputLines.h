/// The InputLines class reads lines from a list of input text files in an IO
/// efficient and parallel way. Each file is split up into blocks, where all
/// blocks except those at the end of a file have the same size. Files are read
/// exactly at block boundaries, without any prior seeking to ensure that reads
/// happen at line boundaries. Both file reads and opens can occur in parallel.
///
/// To use the class, a thread simply calls read() on a shared InputLines
/// instance with a suitably sized buffer (see getMinimumBufferCapacity()) when
/// it is ready for data. This class uses the "pimpl" idiom - copies are cheap
/// and shallow.
///
/// The maximum number of open file descriptors will be equal to the minimum
/// of the number of input files and the number of distinct threads calling
/// read(), so that thousands of input files can be used without having to
/// worry about per-process file descriptor limits.
///
/// Though disk reads happen exactly at block boundaries (and thus may split
/// lines), the range of characters returned by read() calls will always
/// correspond to some complete set of lines. The joining of line fragments
/// and assignment of full lines to reading threads is wait-free on platforms
/// that support atomic compare-and-swap of pointers.
///
/// Finally, as far as this class is concerned, a line is a sequence of no more
/// than MAX_LINE_SIZE bytes ending with LF, CR or CRLF.
