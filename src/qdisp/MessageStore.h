/** Store messages issued by Qserv workers and czar
 *
 * For each SQL query, these messages are stored in a MySQL message table
 * so that mysql-proxy can retrieve it and log it or send error messages
 * to client. These messages are also stored in QMeta in the QMessages
 * table.
 *
 * `msgSource` is used to help sort the messages into appropriate
 * categories. "COMPLETE", "MULITERROR", "EXECFAIL", and "CANCEL" are
 * reserved for specific cases.
 * "MULTIERROR" - is a combined error message that is placed in the
 *      messages_# table specific to the query and is sent to the user
 *      by the proxy. This is not added to QMessages.
 * "COMPLETE" - indicates that there were no problems with a particular job.
 * "CANCEL" - indicates the job was cancelled by the system
 * "EXECFAIL" - indicates that a job has been killed by the executive
 *      because merging or a different job failed.
