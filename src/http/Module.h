     *   Replication/Ingest systems. The key is also required when requesting sensitive
     *   information from the system. The "administrator"-level "admin_auth_key" superseeds
     *   "auth_key" by adding elevated privileges to requests. If "admin_auth_key" is found
     *   in the body then "auth_key" (if any provided) will be ignored, and it won't be
     *   validated if present. It's up to a specific module to decide on how to (or if)
     *   use the administrative privileges.
