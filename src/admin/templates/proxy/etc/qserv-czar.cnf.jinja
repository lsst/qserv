[replication]

# This section contains parameters related to the Czar management service
# that is used by the Replication System to manage Qserv Czaar or to acquire
# monitoring stats from Czar. The Czar is required to self-register
# themselves with the Replication System's Registry that can be contacted
# at a location specified via connection parameters 'registry_host' and
# 'registry_port'. Configuration parameters 'instance_id', 'auth_key'
# and 'admin_auth_key' represent the security context of the Czar control
# protocol. This context is required to be provided by the Czar when registering
# itself with the Registry. The context is also used by the management
# service when processing management requests sent to the service by
# the Replication Controller or relevant applications.
#
# The Czar is required to periodically update its registration status at
# the interval specified at 'registry_heartbeat_ival_sec'. The Czar status
# includes (at least):
#   - the unique identifier of the Czar
#   - the FQDN of a host (or a pod) where the Czar is run
#   - the HTTP port of the Czar management service (parameter 'http_port')

# The unique instance of the Replication System's domain.
