.. warning:: Known Issues and Limitations:

    - The API has a confusing inconsistency in the naming convention of identifiers ``ID``, ``job-id``, ``jobId``,
      ``query-id`` and ``queryId``. These are used interchangeably in the documentation and error messages posted
      by Qserv. In reality, they all refer to the same entity - the autogenerated unique identifiers of the user
      queries submitted via this interface. This inconsistency will be addressed in the future.

    - There is no way in the current API to get errors on queries failed during the asynchronous processing. The only
      tests made by the ``SUBMIT`` command are to ensure that:

      - the query syntax is valid
      - the query refers to the correct context (names of databases, tables, columns)
      
      Any problems detected by Qserv at the query entry point will be reported right away.

Asynchronous Query API
######################

This is a summary of Qserv's asynchronous query API, as developed in:

- https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/DM-4451

Submitting Queries
==================

The general syntax for submitting queries for asynchronous processing is:

.. code-block:: sql

    SUBMIT <query-text>

This is illustrated by the following example:

.. code-block:: sql

    SUBMIT SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object WHERE coord_ra != 0

If the query validation succeded and the query placed into a processing queue, the command will always return one row with
two columns, where the particularly interesting column is ``jobId``:

.. code-block::

    +--------+---------------------+
    | jobId  | resultLocation      |
    +--------+---------------------+
    | 313689 | table:result_313689 |
    +--------+---------------------+


At this poing the query is running asynchronously. The ``jobId`` is the unique identifier of the query that can be used
for checking the query status, retrieving the results, or cancelling the query.

Checking Status 
===============

Based on the ``jobId`` returned by the ``SUBMIT`` command, you can check the status of the query by querying the
``information_schema.processlist`` table:

.. code-block::

    SELECT * FROM information_schema.processlist WHERE id=313689\G

**Note**: ``\G`` is a MySQL command that formats the output. It's not part of the SQL syntax.
The command is quite handy to display result sets comprising many columns or having long values of
the columns in a more readable format.

If the query is still being executed the information schema query will return a row with the following columns:

.. code-block::

    *************************** 1. row ***************************
             ID: 313689
           TYPE: ASYNC
           CZAR: proxy
        CZAR_ID: 9
      SUBMITTED: 2025-02-06 08:58:18
        UPDATED: 2025-02-06 08:58:18
         CHUNKS: 1477
    CHUNKS_COMP: 739
          QUERY: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object WHERE coord_ra != 0

Particularly interesting columns here are:

- ``ID``: the unique identifier of the original query (it's the same as ``jobId`` reported by the ``SUBMIT`` command)
- ``TYPE``: the query type, which is always ``ASYNC`` for asynchronous queries
- ``SUBMITTED``: the timestamp when the query was submitted
- ``UPDATED``: the timestamp of the last update of the query status
- ``CHUNKS``: the total number of chunks to be processed
- ``CHUNKS_COMP``: the number of chunks already processed

The user may periodically repeat this command to compute the performance metrics of the query execution
ad to get an estimate of the remaining time to completion.

One can also use the following information commands to get the status of all active queries:

.. code-block:: sql

    SHOW PROCESSLIST
    SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST

For example the ``SHOW PROCESSLIST`` command will return:

.. code-block::

    +--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------------+
    | ID     | COMMAND | CZAR  | CZAR_ID | SUBMITTED           | UPDATED             | CHUNKS | CHUNKS_COMP | QUERY                            |
    +--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------------+
    | 313689 | ASYNC   | proxy |       9 | 2025-02-06 08:58:18 | 2025-02-06 08:58:18 |   1477 |           1 | SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dp02_dc2_ca |
    +--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------------+

The result set of the ``PROCESSLIST`` queries will be empty if the query has already completed. In this case, the query status can be retrieved
by querying the query history table:

.. code-block::

    SELECT * FROM information_schema.queries WHERE id=313689\G

The query will return:

.. code-block::

    *************************** 1. row ***************************
                ID: 313689
              TYPE: ASYNC
              CZAR: proxy
           CZAR_ID: 9
            STATUS: COMPLETED
         SUBMITTED: 2025-02-06 08:58:18
         COMPLETED: 2025-02-06 08:58:21
          RETURNED: NULL
            CHUNKS: 1477
             BYTES: 13856
    ROWS_COLLECTED: 1477
              ROWS: 1
               DBS: dp02_dc2_catalogs
             QUERY: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object WHERE coord_ra !=0

Particularly interesting columns here are:

- ``STATUS``: the query status, which can be one of: ``EXECUTING``, ``COMPLETED``, ``FAILED``, or ``ABORTED``

Retrieving Results
==================

To retrieve the results of a query, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM qserv_result(<query-id>)

This will return the full results (columns and rows) of the original query corresponding to the provided identifier of
the query.

For example, the following query will return the results of the query with ``jobId`` of ``313689``:

.. code-block::

    SELECT * FROM qserv_result(313689)
    +-----------+
    | COUNT(*)  |
    +-----------+
    | 278318452 |
    +-----------+

The command may be called one time only. The query result table will be deleted after returning the result set.
Any subsequent attempts to retrieve the results will return an error message:

.. code-block::

    SELECT * FROM qserv_result(313689)
    ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 1: Table 'qservResult.result_313689' doesn't exist

Cancellation
============

The general syntax for cancelling running queries is:

.. code-block:: sql

    CANCEL <query-id>

The following example illustrates the technique for cancelling a query that is supposed to take
a long time to complete (the query produces a very large result set):

.. code-block::

    SUBMIT SELECT objectId FROM dp02_dc2_catalogs.Object
    +--------+---------------------+
    | jobId  | resultLocation      |
    +--------+---------------------+
    | 311818 | table:result_311818 |
    +--------+---------------------+

    CANCEL 311816
    +--------------------------------------+
    | command                              |
    +--------------------------------------+
    | Trying to kill query: CANCEL 311818  |
    +--------------------------------------+

Note that it's okay to call the ``CANCEL`` command multiple times. If the query has already completed, the command will
post the following error message:

.. code-block::

    CANCEL 311818
    ERROR 4005 (Proxy) at line 1: KILL/CANCEL failed: Unknown or finished query ID: CANCEL 311818
